However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote, \"My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with--for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel--and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action.\"", "questions": [{"question": "What type of government investigations apply to civil disobedience?", "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is a way you can show police officers civil disobedience ?", "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What should be avoided when talking to authorities?", "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What reasons cause failure of the disobedience with authorities?", "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Why do some people purposely resist officers of the law?", "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What applies to both collecting taxes and searching property?", "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "Why do some people find it hard to not talk to a tax agent?", "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "Who do some tax agents want to make and impression on during an arrest?", "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "What does someone diagnosed as a maniac need to decide  when dealing with police?", "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "What did Thoreau believe about talking to police officers?", "is_impossible": true}]}, {"id": "18_17", "context": "Some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract, which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established, or else suffer the penalties set out in the law.

It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, \"Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged,\" but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, \"Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty.\" A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two.

During the Vietnam War era, the Chicago Eight used a political defense, while Benjamin Spock used a technical defense. In countries such as the United States whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes, some civil disobedients seek jury nullification.
