The ozone case communicated to lay persons \"with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors derived from the popular culture\" and related to \"immediate risks with everyday relevance\", while the public opinion on climate change sees no imminent danger. The stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts. In case of the IPCC conclusions and the failure of the Kyoto Protocol, varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem. In the UK, a report for a House of Lords committee asked to urge the IPCC to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but the Stern Review ordered by the UK government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human-made climate change.", "questions": [{"question": "Who said people involved in the ozone situation had \"a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties\"?", "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What remain unsolved problems with the Kyoto Protocol?", "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What conflicts did the ozone mitigation reduce?", "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who ordered the Stern Review?", "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who stated that that scientific ignorance was what caused uncertainties of global warming?", "is_impossible": true}, {"question": "What metaphors explained global warming?

In an area of science where our scientific understanding is rapidly changing, this has been raised as a serious shortcoming in a body which is widely regarded as the ultimate authority on the science.
