For example, factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field, a basic problem of algebraic number theory, bears some resemblance with ramification in geometry. Such ramification questions occur even in number-theoretic questions solely concerned with integers. For example, prime ideals in the ring of integers of quadratic number fields can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity, a statement that concerns the solvability of quadratic equations", "questions": ["What are the points of algebro-geometric objects?", "What does factorization of prime ideals approximate?", "In what type of ring can prime ideals be used for validating quadratic reciprocity?", "What does quadratic reciprocity seek to achieve?"]}, {"id": "41_30", "context": "In particular, this norm gets smaller when a number is multiplied by p, in sharp contrast to the usual absolute value (also referred to as the infinite prime). While completing Q (roughly, filling the gaps) with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers, completing with respect to the p-adic norm |\u2212|p yields the field of p-adic numbers. These are essentially all possible ways to complete Q, by Ostrowski's theorem. Certain arithmetic questions related to Q or more general global fields may be transferred back and forth to the completed (or local) fields. This local-global principle again underlines the importance of primes to number theory.", "questions": ["What happens to the norm when a number is multiplied by p?", "To what may general global fields be transferred to or from?", "Completing Q with respect to what will produce the field of real numbers?", "What principle highlights the significance of primes in number theory"]}, {"id": "41_31", "context": "Prime numbers have influenced many artists and writers. The French composer Olivier Messiaen used prime numbers to create ametrical music through \"natural phenomena\".
